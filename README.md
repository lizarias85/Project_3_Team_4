## Overview

World Health Organization (WHO) Director has determined that the upsurge of mpox in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and a growing number of countries in Africa constitutes a public health emergency of international concern. Our Team embarked upon the goal of using image classication to identify early on the MPox virus.

## Introduction

This project utilized a dataset consististing of four image classes: Monkeypox, Chickenpox, Measles, and other. The project encompasses ML techniques such as Pytorch Lightning CNN, TensorFlow, and scikit-learn
that were used for data sourcing, transformation, exploratory data analysis and model training.

## Features

- Identify with a high accuracy rate the MPox virus via images
- TBD
- TBD

## Data

The dataset used in this project was sourced from Kaggle and includes 770 images.

The dataset was divided into 4 folders:

- Monkeypox
- Chickenpox
- Measles
- Other


## Installation

To run this project locally, you'll need Python and additional libraries installed. Use the following command to install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install scikit-learn
pip install matplotlib
pip install Tensorflow
pip install os
pip install requests
pip install pandas
pip install numpy
pip install cv2
pip install seaborn
pip install pil
```

## Methodology 

1. ***Exploratory Data Analysis***  
* Took images and vectorized into
* 
*  
  
2. ***Data Preparation***  
* Created a dataframe with image path list and classes as labels  
* Split the dataset into training and test sets
* Used a label encoder to to convert the labels to numbers

3. ***Model Selection***
* Convolutional neural network (CNN) due to its ability to recognize patterns in images


4. ***Model Validation***
* Cross Validation to confirm consistency of results across several randomized folds
*

5.  ***Model Interpretation***
* Feature Importance comparison and analysis
